                <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Hospitals are a critical component of any healthcare system, providing essential services to individuals in need of medical attention. They offer a range of specialized care, including emergency services, surgical procedures, diagnostic testing, and rehabilitation.</p>

                <p>In addition to providing medical treatment, hospitals also play an important role in public health and disease prevention. They are often involved in research and education, and work closely with public health officials to monitor and respond to outbreaks of infectious diseases.</p>
