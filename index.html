                      </svg><p>Robotic surgery, also known as robot-assisted surgery, is a type of minimally invasive surgical procedure that uses robotic technology to assist surgeons in performing complex surgeries with greater precision and control. Robotic surgery systems typically consist of a console where the surgeon sits, a robotic arm equipped with surgical instruments, and a high-resolution camera that provides a clear, magnified view of the surgical site.</p>
                      <p>
                        During robotic surgery, the surgeon sits at the console and controls the movement of the robotic arm, which is guided by the surgeon's movements and commands. The robotic arm is equipped with a range of surgical instruments, such as scalpels, scissors, and forceps, which are controlled by the surgeon using hand and foot controls.

                        Neurologists work closely with other medical professionals, such as neurosurgeons, physical therapists, and occupational therapists, to provide comprehensive care to patients with neurological conditions. They may also collaborate with other specialists, such as neuro-oncologists and neurogeneticists, to manage complex neurological conditions that require a multidisciplinary approach.

                        Orthopedic surgeons also play a key role in the management of sports injuries, such as torn ligaments or tendons. They work with athletes of all ages and skill levels to provide individualized care that helps to optimize recovery and minimize the risk of future injuries. This can involve the use of surgical and non-surgical treatment options, as well as rehabilitation and conditioning programs to improve strength, flexibility, and overall fitness.
